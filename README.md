# AI Prompt Engineering Course

This is the repository for the AI Prompt Engineering Course, a web application designed to teach the art and science of prompt engineering.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive, interactive, and engaging learning experience for students who want to master prompt engineering. The application includes a landing page, user authentication, a student dashboard, and course content.

### Features

*   **User Authentication:** Students can sign up, sign in, and reset their passwords.
*   **Student Dashboard:** Once enrolled, students can access their course materials and download resources.
*   **Internationalization:** The application supports both English and Arabic.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with the following technologies:

*   **Vite:** A fast build tool that provides a modern development experience.
*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **shadcn/ui:** A collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Supabase:** A backend-as-a-service platform that provides a database, authentication, and more.
*   **React Hook Form:** A library for building performant, flexible, and extensible forms.
*   **Zod:** A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
*   **Sonner:** A toast notification library for React.
